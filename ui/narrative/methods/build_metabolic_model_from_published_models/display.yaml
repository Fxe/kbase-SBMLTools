    <p>Accurate metabolic models are based on well-curated genome annotations which are labor intensive and thus highly valuable. This method permits users to construct a metabolic model of a new organism based on previously published models in the KBase catalog by translating to another organism rather than constructing and curating it from scratch. The method selects the closest published models and performs proteome comparison between the genomes to identify genes encoding potentially orthologous proteins in the two organisms.</p>
